DOS Games August Jam 2022 entry "Donkey.bas in space"

Primary development host system: Linux
Primary development tools: Open Watcom v2.0, nasm, GNU make.

Development is done as it's own standalone repository instead of adding
more bloat and junk to the main DOSLIB project. However, this project
does contain some code copy-pasted and adapted from DOSLIB.
